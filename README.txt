Overview:
  Snooker is Snooker. It requires two networked players, though another Snooker application can connect locally using the loopback (127.0.0.1). Gameplay can be either GUI driven, or not. Due to issues with UDK the balls don't always behave properly. So expect fouls to build up quickly.

Controls:
  GUI-Driven:
    Left click on the UI.
    Left Ctrl - switch from GUI-driven.

  Other:
    Mouse:
      Left Button - shoots the cue ball when it is not in hand. Otherwise places the cue ball.
      Middle Button - cycles through the camera views.
      Right Button + Mouse Move - rotates the cue.
      Mouse Wheel - adjusts shot power.
  
    Keyboard:
      W,S,A,D - moves the camera in Free View and Cue Ball View.
      1,2,3 - cycles through the camera views.
      Left Ctrl - switch to GUI-driven.
